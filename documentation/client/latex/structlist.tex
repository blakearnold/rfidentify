\subsection{Detailed Description}
standardization:

a list ends with a cell that looks like:


\begin{DoxyCode}
     +---+---+   
---> | v | 0 |   
     +---+---+   
\end{DoxyCode}


and empty list then looks like:


\begin{DoxyCode}
+---+---+   
| 0 | 0 |   
+---+---+   
\end{DoxyCode}


it should look like this:


\begin{DoxyCode}
0
\end{DoxyCode}


but this doesnt work, because we would need to be able to modify the pointers but of course they are passed by value...

so this implementation needs to be careful on edge cases, checking when there are fewer than 2 elements and whatnot
